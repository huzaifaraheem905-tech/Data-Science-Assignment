    "## 1. Background & Scenario\n",
    "Bombay Hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners across New England.\n",
    "According to their cost model, the weekly operating cost for a franchise is calculated as:\n",
    "W=₹1000+₹5×XW = ₹1000 + ₹5 \\times XW=₹1000+₹5×X \n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tW = weekly operating cost\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tX = number of units produced per week\n",
    "\n",
    "For a restaurant producing 600 units per week:\n",
    "W=₹1000+₹5×600=₹4000W = ₹1000 + ₹5 \\times 600 = ₹4000W=₹1000+₹5×600=₹4000 \n",
    "However, recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that actual weekly operating costs are higher than this predicted value. To investigate, the company collected data from 25 restaurants, finding that the average weekly cost was ₹3050. The goal is to test the claim that the real mean cost is greater than ₹4000.\n"
